"""Contracts that only exist as matching strings across a language boundary.

Nothing in Python or Node checks these; they hold only because two files
happen to spell the same word. One of them already broke the live bridge
silently — the Node channel called a `reply` subcommand while Python still
named it `yanit` — so each one gets an assertion that reads the string from
the real source on both sides. A regex that fails to find its target must
fail the test, never quietly pass."""
